# üñ•Ô∏è LinkLearning

This project is a full-stack application that aims to simulate the business needs of a client-to-engineering-team relationship. The client requested a minimally viable product for a learning app within their education services, emphasizing functionality, modern design, and authentication/session management. Link Learning uses a Vercel-hosted PostgreSQL database and Next.js for the frontend.

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Instructor view

### Description

The Instructor View is a component of our learning platform designed specifically for instructors. It provides tools and features to help instructors manage cohorts, track student progress, and facilitate effective teaching. It is designed to provide instructors with a comprehensive set of tools to manage their classes effectively,

* **Technology Stack**: Built using Next.js version 14, leveraging the new App router feautre for improved routing and nav. The frontend is develped with React, used for its powerful state management and component based architecture to create a dynamic and interactive user experience. Styling is done with ailwind CSS, which allows for rapid UI development with its utility-first approach.

### File Structure
* **app > Components > instructor**: The files for the Instructor Dashboard are organized wihtin the 'Components' folder, which is located inside the 'app' folder. This structure helps in keeping the dashboard-realted components separate from other parts of the app, ensuring maintanilbility and scalibility.

### Differences from Student Dashboard
* **Cohort Management**: Instructors can manage multiple cohorts, whereas students only have access to their own cohort information.

* **Edit Capabilities**: Instructors have the ability to edit student information, grades, and attendance records, which is not possible on the Student Dashboard.
